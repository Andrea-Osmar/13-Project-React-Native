# Hogwarts sorting ceremonywith React Native ⚡️⚡️

The sorting ceremony takes place at Hogwarts every year the sort the new students into the 4 houses of the founders.
Do you want to know which house you belong to?
Are you Gryffindor? Are you Hufflepuff? Are you Slytherin? Are you Ravenclaw? Shake your phone and you will find out!

## The App

It took a while to figure out what I wanted my first app to be. But since I’m a big Potter fan I realised that the sorting hat would be perfect. It would also fulfill the requirements with fetching data from an api and use one of the mobile sensors.
I had some issues with vs code and found it easier to work and troubleshoot in expo.io
